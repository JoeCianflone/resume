## Bamburgs

+ https://github.com/joecianflone/bamburgs-cli

My thinking on CSS/JavaScript have evolved over the years. Bamburgs represents my latest evolution in thinking and it is the successor to Heisenberg. I made this a separate repository and new name because it's so radically different from Heisenberg and such a different philosophy that it needed to be something different. The Sass that is here is modeled on BeadCSS and is written in Sass and I use PostCSS for some added functionality. This also moves away from Webpack and Gulp for tooling and into pure NPM script. I wrote these as a challenge to see if I could use just npm scripts and it worked so well that I integrated it into Bamburgs. While this is currently in alpha, I'm starting to integrate it into projects that can be viewed on Twitch and LiveEDU.

## Heisenberg Toolkit
+ https://github.com/JoeCianflone/heisenberg-toolkit

Heisenberg is a toolbox of various projects put together in a sensible way for rapid development of custom projects and websites-—this isn't another Bootstrap. It also features a very easy way to write clean Javascript with an abstracted Pub/Sub event system in vanilla JS. This project is being used in production environments and is a base for sites such as: https://mcclatchy.com and https://bulbrite.com/ among others.

## Laravel-Exlixir-Sass-Compass

This project used to be located at https://github.com/rynocouse/laravel-elixir-compass but the maintainer had decided he no longer wanted to control the project. I've since taken over and I've released several new versions, with multiple fixes, to the community and has had 17,000+ downloads.
